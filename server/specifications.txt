I think we make the command in the git server (so we can host database locally there) 
    Then we run a command which send the note to the server and the server will take it from there 

Do we use the git system or just http tbh? A POST or GIT request would be fine and it wouldn't require git overhead 
    But for S we want to use a few technologies and build out from there so git and HTTP would both be available
